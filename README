Welcome to our cellular automata program!

Before we begin, be sure you have a virtual environment running and have Python3 as well as the following installed: 

- Numpy
- Pygame

After you have all this done, you can run the program you wish to. 

There are 2 programs available as a part of this project, which are separated into two different directories. If you 
wish to run the Elementary Cellular Automata implementation, navigate to the elementary_automata directory. On the 
other hand, if you want to run the Brian's Brain simulation, you'll want to navigate into the brians_brain directory. 

Once you are in the preffered directory, run the main.py file to get started(the recommended command is: python3 main.py). 

Instructions on how to use each program will be printed in the terminal. 


Most importantly please have fun!
